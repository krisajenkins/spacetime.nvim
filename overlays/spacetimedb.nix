# @update github-release clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# SpacetimeDB - distributed database with intelligent modules
#
# Upstream publishes prebuilt binaries only; nothing is built from source here,
# so every supported platform needs its own tarball URL and hash in `sources`
# below.
#
# To update to the latest version:
# 1. Check latest release:
#    curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name'
#
# 2. Update the version number below (without the 'v' prefix)
#
# 3. Re-hash every entry in `sources` (nix-prefetch-url caches into the store,
#    so the build that follows won't re-download):
#
#      V=2.9.0
#      for T in aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin \
#               aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu; do
#        U="https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/releases/download/v$V/spacetime-$T.tar.gz"
#        echo "$T  $(nix hash convert --hash-algo sha256 --to sri \
#                     "$(nix-prefetch-url "$U")")"
#      done
#
# 4. Test: nix build .#spacetimedb
#
# Note: Tarball contains two binaries at root level:
#   - spacetimedb-cli (installed as 'spacetime')
#   - spacetimedb-standalone
#
# GitHub: https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
